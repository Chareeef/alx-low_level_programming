# Dynamic Libraries Introduction Project - ALX Formation
Welcome to the Dynamic Libraries Introduction Project, part of the ALX Formation curriculum. This project aims to provide hands-on experience and understanding of dynamic libraries in the context of software development.

### Project Overview
In this project, we will explore the concept of dynamic libraries, also known as shared libraries. Dynamc libraries are external files that contain reusable code and can be linked to different programs at runtime. By using dynamic libraries, we can modularize your code, improve code reusability, and reduce the size of your executable
